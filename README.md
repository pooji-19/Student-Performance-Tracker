StudentPerformanceTracker Project is a comprehensive system designed to manage and analyze student data. It provides functionalities for students, admins, and super admins to efficiently handle various tasks related to student information. This README file serves as a guide to understand the project and its components.
# Project Description
StudentPerformanceTracker Project aims to streamline the process of managing student information within an educational institution. It includes three user roles:

1.Students: They can view their own profile, access their grades, attendance records, and personal information.

2.Admins: Admins have additional privileges and responsibilities. They can manage student records, such as adding new students, updating existing data, and generating reports.

3.Super Admins: Super admins have the highest level of access and control. They can perform all the functions of admins, as well as manage user accounts, grant permissions, and configure system settings.

# Features
1.User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and access the system based on their assigned roles (student, admin, or super admin).

2.Student Management: Admins and super admins can add new students, update existing student records, and delete student profiles if necessary. They can also view student details, such as personal information, grades, and attendance records.

3.Reports Generation: Admins and super admins can generate reports based on various criteria, such as student performance, attendance, or demographic information. These reports provide valuable insights for decision-making.

4.Access Control: Different user roles have distinct access levels and permissions within the system. Super admins can manage user accounts, assign roles, and modify access rights.
